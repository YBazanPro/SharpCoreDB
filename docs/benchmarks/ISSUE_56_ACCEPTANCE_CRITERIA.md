  - Report generator script created

- [ ] **CI/CD Integration**
  - Benchmark runs can be triggered manually in CI
  - Results stored in artifact store
  - Report auto-generated from raw data
  - No blocking (benchmarks don't fail builds, just publish results)

## Phase 2: Benchmark v2 and Expansion (Weeks 8-11, Milestone M3)

### Functional Additions

- [ ] **Report v2 Published**
  - Enhanced analysis with deeper dives
  - Per-scenario explanations of results
  - Tuning profiles documented (default vs optimized)
  - Confidence intervals added
  - Report published: `docs/benchmarks/REPORT_V2.md`

- [ ] **Additional Test Runs**
  - Rerun on different hardware (if feasible):
    - Linux (Ubuntu 24.04 LTS)
    - Optional: macOS or small hardware
  - Results clearly labeled by environment
  - Cross-environment consistency noted (or explained)

- [ ] **Memory and GC Analysis**
  - Memory growth curves plotted over time
  - GC pause times measured (if available)
  - Peak memory usage documented
  - Memory efficiency (bytes per document/vector) calculated

- [ ] **Macro Workload Scenario**
  - Long-running mixed workload (1-hour)
  - Measures tail latency stability
  - Identifies memory leaks or regressions over time
  - Results included in Report v2

### Non-Functional

- [ ] **Interpretation Guide Published**
  - FAQ: "Why is X faster at Y?"
  - FAQ: "How do these results apply to my use case?"
  - FAQ: "Can I trust this benchmark?"
  - Examples of correct vs incorrect interpretation

- [ ] **Community Rerun Capability**
  - Scripts are self-contained and documented
