# SharpCoreDB Project Status

**Version:** 1.6.0  
**Status:** ✅ Production Ready — All Known Limitations Resolved  
**Last Updated:** March 14, 2026

## 🎯 Current Status

> **Implementation audit (March 14, 2026):** Engine limitation remediation pass completed for parser/runtime behavior. All previously documented gaps are now implemented and validated, including the parameterized `ExecuteCompiled` hang (root cause: infinite loop in `FastSqlLexer` on `?` placeholders).

SharpCoreDB is a **production-ready, high-performance embedded AND networked database** for .NET 10 with enterprise-scale distributed capabilities, server mode, and advanced GraphRAG analytics.

### ✅ Resolved During Latest Remediation Pass

- `IS NULL` / `IS NOT NULL` evaluation parity across runtime scan, join helper path, and compiled predicate path.
- German locale `ß/ss` equivalence in locale-aware equality via `CompareOptions.IgnoreNonSpace`.
- Scalar function parsing in SELECT columns (including `COALESCE(...)`) via expression-backed column parsing.
- Enhanced SQL parser trailing-token validation to reliably set `HasErrors` on malformed trailing content.
- LINQ translator support for `ExpressionType.Convert`/`ConvertChecked` in enum-related comparisons.

### ✅ Previously Deferred Limitation — Resolved

- `SingleFileDatabase.ExecuteCompiled` with parameterized plans previously hung due to an infinite loop in `FastSqlLexer.NextToken()` — the `?` character was not recognized, and the default case did not advance the read position.
- **Fixed:** `FastSqlLexer` (parameter token + safety advance), `EnhancedSqlParser` (`?` placeholder parsing), `QueryCompiler` (parameterized plan compilation). `IAsyncDisposable` lifecycle also implemented across all storage providers.

### 🧪 Validation Baseline

- Latest CI-style run: **1,490 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped**.
- Locale-collation suite: **21 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped**.
