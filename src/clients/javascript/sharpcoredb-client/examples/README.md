# @sharpcoredb/client Examples

This directory contains examples demonstrating how to use @sharpcoredb/client to connect to and interact with SharpCoreDB Server.

## Prerequisites

Before running the examples, ensure you have:

1. **SharpCoreDB Server running** on `localhost:5001` (gRPC) or `localhost:8443` (HTTP/WebSocket)
2. **Node.js 16+** installed
3. **@sharpcoredb/client** installed:
   ```bash
   cd clients/javascript/sharpcoredb-client
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

## Examples

### 1. Basic Connection (`basic-example.js`)

Demonstrates fundamental database operations:
- Connecting to SharpCoreDB Server
- Creating tables
- Inserting and querying data
- Error handling

```bash
node examples/basic-example.js
```

### 2. Connection Pooling (`pooling-example.js`)

Shows how to use connection pooling for high-performance applications:
- Creating a connection pool
- Concurrent worker tasks
- Pool statistics and monitoring
- Performance measurements

```bash
node examples/pooling-example.js
```

## Running Examples

1. **Start SharpCoreDB Server** (see main documentation)
2. **Build the client**:
   ```bash
   cd clients/javascript/sharpcoredb-client
   npm run build
   ```
3. **Run examples**:
   ```bash
   node examples/basic-example.js
   node examples/pooling-example.js
   ```

## Configuration

Examples use default connection settings. To customize:

```javascript
// Custom connection
const connection = await connect('grpc://your-server:5001', {
  database: 'yourdb',
  username: 'user',
  password: 'pass',
  timeout: 5000
});

// Custom pool
const pool = await createPool('your-server', 5001, {
  database: 'yourdb',
  maxConnections: 20,
  acquireTimeout: 15000
});
```

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors
- Ensure SharpCoreDB Server is running
- Check firewall settings (ports 5001/8443)
- Verify TLS certificates if using HTTPS

### Import Errors
- Build the client first: `npm run build`
- Check that `dist/index.js` exists

### Protocol Errors
- Try different protocols: `grpc://`, `https://`, `ws://`
- Check server logs for connection attempts
