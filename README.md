## 📌 **Current Status — v1.6.0 (March 20, 2026)**

### ✅ **Production-Ready: ALL Phase 1-12 Features Complete (100%)**

**SharpCoreDB v1.6.0 is the synchronized package release for the current feature and fix set: all NuGet packages now ship on the same version, the package documentation has been refreshed, and the optional Event Sourcing, Projections, and CQRS packages are documented as first-class companions to the core engine.**

#### 🎉 **Major Milestone: All Core Features + Server Complete**

**Phase 1-12 (100% Complete):** SharpCoreDB is now a **fully-featured, production-ready embedded AND networked database** with advanced analytics, vector search, graph algorithms, GraphRAG analytics, distributed capabilities, and server mode.

**Latest Achievement:** 🚀 **Phase 12 - SharpCoreDB.Graph.Advanced COMPLETE (100%)**  
SharpCoreDB now includes a dedicated **advanced graph analytics and GraphRAG package** with community detection, centrality metrics, subgraph analysis, and graph-aware semantic ranking.

**Latest Package Delivered:**
- ✅ `SharpCoreDB.Graph.Advanced`
- ✅ GraphRAG ranking and vector integration
- ✅ SQL graph analytics helpers
- ✅ Community detection and centrality metrics
- ✅ Subgraph analysis and profiling utilities

**Server Features Delivered:**
- ✅ gRPC protocol (HTTP/2 + HTTP/3, primary protocol)
- ✅ Binary TCP protocol handler
- ✅ HTTPS REST API (DatabaseController)
- ✅ WebSocket streaming protocol (real-time query streaming)
- ✅ JWT authentication + Role-Based Access Control
- ✅ Mutual TLS (certificate-based authentication)
- ✅ Multi-database registry with system databases
- ✅ Connection pooling (1000+ concurrent connections)
- ✅ Health checks & metrics (Prometheus-compatible)

### 📈 Performance Improvements (March 20, 2026)

After the `IAsyncDisposable` lifecycle refactor and SQL lexer/parser fixes, benchmarks show **zero regressions** and significant gains:

| Benchmark | Before | After | Improvement |
|-----------|-------:|------:|:------------|
| Single-File SELECT (Unencrypted) | 4.01 ms | **1.81 ms** | **55% faster** |
| Single-File SELECT (Encrypted) | 2.74 ms | **1.57 ms** | **43% faster** |
| AppendOnly UPDATE | 143.42 ms | **70.36 ms** | **51% faster** |
| Dir Encrypted UPDATE | 9.16 ms | **7.91 ms** | **14% faster** |

All other benchmarks (25 total) remain stable. Full results: [`docs/BENCHMARK_RESULTS.md`](docs/BENCHMARK_RESULTS.md)

## ⚡ Event Sourcing + CQRS Foundation (v1.6.0 / V 1.60)

`SharpCoreDB.EventSourcing` is now available as a dedicated optional package for append-only streams, global ordering, replay, and snapshot persistence in both embedded and server-backed deployments.
`SharpCoreDB.Projections` is available as an optional projection scaffold package for registration, checkpointing, runner primitives, and OpenTelemetry-ready projection metrics.
`SharpCoreDB.CQRS` is available as an optional CQRS scaffold package for command dispatching, aggregate root base support, and outbox primitives.

### Which package should I use?

| Package | Use it for | What it does exactly | What it does not do |
|---------|------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| `SharpCoreDB.EventSourcing` | Persisting and replaying business events | Stores append-only events per stream, exposes a global ordered feed, supports snapshots, aggregate rehydration, and optional upcasting | Does not dispatch commands or run projections |
| `SharpCoreDB.Projections` | Building read models from stored events | Registers projections, runs them inline or in the background, persists checkpoints, and exposes projection metrics | Does not store events or handle command dispatch |
| `SharpCoreDB.CQRS` | Modeling the command side and reliable message publication | Defines commands and handlers, dispatches commands, collects aggregate events, and manages an outbox with retry/dead-letter support | Does not persist event streams or execute projections |

### How the three packages fit together

- Use `SharpCoreDB.EventSourcing` to **store the truth as events**.
- Use `SharpCoreDB.Projections` to **turn those events into read models**.
- Use `SharpCoreDB.CQRS` to **handle commands and publish integration messages reliably**.

### What is available now

- ✅ Append-only per-stream event storage
- ✅ Global ordered event feed
- ✅ In-memory and persistent (`SharpCoreDbEventStore`) implementations
- ✅ Point-in-time reconstruction by stream sequence
- ✅ Snapshot persistence APIs
- ✅ Snapshot-aware aggregate loading (`LoadWithSnapshotAsync`)
- ✅ Optional snapshot policy helpers (`SnapshotPolicy`, `AppendEventsWithSnapshotPolicyAsync`)
- ✅ Optional projection package scaffold (`ProjectionBuilder`, checkpoints, inline runner)
- ✅ Optional OpenTelemetry projection metrics (`OpenTelemetryProjectionMetrics`, meter `SharpCoreDB.Projections`)
- ✅ Optional CQRS scaffold (`ICommand`, `ICommandHandler<TCommand>`, `AggregateRoot`, `IOutboxStore`)

### Current scope

- ES primitives are production-ready.
- CQRS orchestration, projection hosting, and MediatR integration remain optional follow-up packages.

### Quickstart

```csharp
using SharpCoreDB.EventSourcing;

var eventStore = new InMemoryEventStore();
var streamId = new EventStreamId("order-1001");

await eventStore.AppendEventAsync(
    streamId,
    new EventAppendEntry(
        EventType: "OrderCreated",
        Payload: """{"orderId":"order-1001","total":199.99}"""u8.ToArray(),
        Metadata: ReadOnlyMemory<byte>.Empty,
        TimestampUtc: DateTimeOffset.UtcNow));

var loadResult = await eventStore.LoadWithSnapshotAsync(
    streamId,
    fromEvents: static events => OrderAggregate.FromEventStream(events),
    fromSnapshot: static snapshotData => OrderAggregate.FromSnapshot(snapshotData),
    replayFromSnapshot: static (aggregate, events) => aggregate.Replay(events));
```

- In-memory demo: `Examples/EventSourcing/OrderManagement`

## 🌐 Server Mode: Run SharpCoreDB as a Real Network Database Server

SharpCoreDB is no longer only an embedded database. In `Server` mode it can run as a **real multi-database network server** with secure remote access over your LAN, datacenter, or cloud network.

### What you get in Server mode

- **Primary protocol: gRPC (HTTPS, HTTP/2 + HTTP/3)** for high-throughput and streaming scenarios
- **Secondary protocols:** HTTPS REST API and WebSocket streaming
- **Strict security defaults:** TLS 1.2+, JWT auth, optional mTLS, RBAC
- **Multi-database hosting:** system databases + user databases in one server process
- **Production operations:** health checks, metrics, connection pooling, graceful shutdown

### Quick network setup

1. Install packages:
   - `SharpCoreDB.Server`
   - `SharpCoreDB.Client`
2. Configure TLS certificate and server settings in `appsettings.json`.
3. Start the server:

```bash
dotnet run --project src/SharpCoreDB.Server -c Release
```

4. Verify endpoints:
   - Health: `https://localhost:8443/health`
   - gRPC endpoint: `https://localhost:5001`

### Installers and deployment options

- **Windows Service installer:** `installers/windows/install-service.ps1`
- **Linux systemd installer:** `installers/linux/install.sh`
- **macOS launchd installer:** `installers/macos/install.sh`
- **Docker / Docker Compose:** `src/SharpCoreDB.Server/docker-compose.yml`
